h1. What

This is an update of v1.1 of the Slideshow screenlet for Gnome/Compiz, originally written by Helder Whise.
It dramatically improves the image quality, by avoiding re-resizes, and using better resize algorithims. It also adds the ability to center images that have had their aspect ratios preserved.
